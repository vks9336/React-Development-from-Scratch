# React Development from Scratch
  ðŸ”¹ Key Features of React     
  Component-Based â€“ UI is broken down into reusable pieces called components.    
  Virtual DOM â€“ Updates only the necessary parts of the UI, improving performance.   
  JSX (JavaScript XML) â€“ A syntax extension that allows writing HTML inside JavaScript. State & Props â€“ Manage data flow efficiently between components.   
  Hooks â€“ Introduced in React 16.8 to allow functional components to manage state and side effects (useState, useEffect, etc.).   
  One-Way Data Binding â€“ Ensures predictable state changes. React Router â€“ Enables navigation without page reloads.   
  Performance Optimizations â€“ Tools like React.memo, useCallback, and lazy loading enhance performance.   

  ðŸ”¹ Core Concepts     
Components â€“ Independent, reusable pieces of UI (Functional & Class components).  
State Management â€“ Controls data within a component (useState, useReducer).  
Props â€“ Pass data from parent to child components.  
Lifecycle Methods (Class components) â€“ componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount.  
Hooks (Functional components) â€“ useEffect, useContext, useRef, etc  

ðŸ”¹ React Ecosystem    
Redux / Context API â€“ State management solutions.
