# React Development from Scratch
  Key Features of React Component-Based – UI is broken down into reusable pieces called components.    
  Virtual DOM – Updates only the necessary parts of the UI, improving performance.   
  JSX (JavaScript XML) – A syntax extension that allows writing HTML inside JavaScript. State & Props – Manage data flow efficiently between components.   
  Hooks – Introduced in React 16.8 to allow functional components to manage state and side effects (useState, useEffect, etc.).   
  One-Way Data Binding – Ensures predictable state changes. React Router – Enables navigation without page reloads.   
  Performance Optimizations – Tools like React.memo, useCallback, and lazy loading enhance performance.
